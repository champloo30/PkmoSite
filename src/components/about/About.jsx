                    <p>
                        Although you may see Baptist in our name we
                        are not a usual Baptist church. We have an
                        eclectic style of worship incorporating the rich
                        aspects of traditional, contemporary, and
                        charismatic experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our ministry has a holistic approach to the
                        flow of the Holy Spirit. We are open to the
                        totality of the Trinity and believe in the
                        supreme sufficiency of the Word of God. We
                        embrace the foundational yet revolutionary
                        tenets of our faith looking unto Jesus Christ
                        our Lord as the architect, fulfillment, and
                        prefect of the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are far from perfect but seek to progress
                        in Kingdom dynamics through our worship,
                        work, and witness. We openly confess we are
                        real people, with real issues, that seek a real
                        God who is able to supply real life solutions!
                        With this in mind we promote an atmosphere
                        of expectation and anticipation of blessings,
                        empowerment and encouragement!

                        If you are looking for a place to connect, grow,
                        and become, your search is over. Come and
                        join us as we bask in the glory our King!
