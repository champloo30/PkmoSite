# pkmoSite
This is a website I built for a church as my first freelance project. This is a basic multi-page site built with React, JavaScript, and Sass. The contact form is linked to a Google Sheets using NoCodeAPI and I also learned about React-Router.
For all code, please see master branch. Thank you!
